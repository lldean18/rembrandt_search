# rembrandt_search

code to download raw RNAseq fastq reads from the SRA (using ones generated by DepMap)

Then to search these reads for sets of primers and output a table of results

We determined that this database does not contain splice variant information and so is
not useful for the purposes we were interested in. Moved onto a different approach.
